1. Recursive Binary Search Algorithm:

Here's a recursive binary search algorithm that returns True if the value '42' is in the array and False otherwise:

```python
def binary_search(arr, left, right):
    if left > right:
        return False

    mid = (left + right) // 2

    if arr[mid] == 42:
        return True
    elif arr[mid] < 42:
        return binary_search(arr, mid + 1, right)
    else:
        return binary_search(arr, left, mid - 1)
```

2. Proving the Algorithm Works:

To prove that this algorithm works for any sorted array and any n, we need to show:
a) It always terminates (doesn't run forever).
b) It always gives the correct answer.

Let's break this down:

a) Termination:
- In each recursive call, we reduce the search space by half.
- The base case (left > right) ensures the algorithm stops when the search space is empty.
- Since we start with a finite array and keep reducing the search space, we will eventually reach the base case.

b) Correctness:
- If the element is in the array, we will find it because:
  - We always check the middle element.
  - If the target is smaller, we search the left half; if larger, the right half.
  - The sorted nature of the array ensures this division is correct.
- If the element is not in the array, we will eventually exhaust the search space and return False.

3. Formal Proof:

To formally prove this, we can use induction on the size of the search space (right - left + 1).

Base case: If the search space is empty (left > right), the algorithm correctly returns False.

Inductive step: Assume the algorithm works for all search spaces of size k or smaller. We need to prove it works for size k+1.
- If arr[mid] == 42, we correctly return True.
- If arr[mid] < 42, we search the right half, which has size <= k.
- If arr[mid] > 42, we search the left half, which has size <= k.

In all cases, we either find the element or reduce to a smaller problem that we've assumed works correctly.

4. From Heuristic to Proved Algorithm:

The key transition from a heuristic to a proved algorithm lies in rigorously establishing:
1. The algorithm always terminates.
2. The algorithm maintains its correctness at each step.
3. The algorithm covers all possible cases.

The intuition behind this is that we're not just relying on the fact that it "seems to work" for test cases, but we're systematically showing that it must work for all possible inputs due to its logical structure.

5. Dafny Implementation:

Now, let's write this algorithm in Dafny with pre and post conditions, and invariants:


Let's break down the Dafny implementation:

1. Pre-conditions (requires):
   - The array is not null.
   - The array is sorted in ascending order.

2. Post-conditions (ensures):
   - The result is true if and only if the target exists in the array within the specified range.

3. Invariants:
   - The recursive method maintains the sorted property of the array.
   - The search range (left to right) is always within the array bounds.

4. Termination:
   - The `decreases right - left` clause proves that the recursion will terminate, as this value decreases with each recursive call.

5. Correctness:
   - The post-condition ensures that the result correctly reflects whether the target is in the array.

This Dafny implementation not only provides the algorithm but also includes formal verification elements that prove its correctness. The pre and post conditions, along with the decreases clause, allow Dafny to verify that the algorithm is correct and will always terminate. */
